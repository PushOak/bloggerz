BloggerZ is the project by Demitry Gavrisenko.

It is a social media web application, similar to facebook and twitter, where users can login/register,
post images and messages, add or remove friends, find other people. The website has light/dark mode for 
easing the stress on eyes, as well as responsive design for viewing conveniences on other devices, 
e.g. cellphones and tablets.

BloggerZ is built using the MERN stack. The following technologies and libraries were used in the building of the project:

- React/Node.js - for the frontend and backend.
- Express for server application.
- MongoDb for storing the user and post information.

  Frontend:
- Material UI and Material ui-icons - a popular react framework for User Interface.
- Redux Toolkit for state management.
- React-Router-Dom for route and page navigation handling.
- YUP - a schema validation library for login/register form validation.
- dotenv - module for environment variables where sensitive information is stored.
- Formik - form management library for React.

  Backend:
- bcrypt - library for securing and hashing passwords.
- body-parser - A middleware for parsing request bodies in Express.js.
- cors -  for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.js applications.
- helmet - for setting various HTTP security headers in Express.js applications.
- Mongoose - library for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions by providing a schema-based solution.
- Morgan - logger for Express.js providing detailed request logs for debugging.
